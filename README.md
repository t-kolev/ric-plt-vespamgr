# RIC VESPA manager

The VESPA manager uses the VES Agent (https://github.com/nokia/ONAP-VESPA)
to adapt near-RT RIC internal statistics' collection using Prometheus 
(xApps and platform containers) to ONAP's VES (VNF event streaming).

The vesmgr container runs two processes: the VESPA manager and the VES
Agent (i.s. VESPA).

The VESPA manager starts and configures the VES Agent.

The VES Agent is a service acting as a bridge between Prometheus and 
ONAP's VES Collector.

# Application metrics definition

The application metrics are defined in the application descriptor.
For each counter, the following fields are required in the "metrics" 
section of the descriptor:

* name - Prometheus name of the counter
* objectName - object name in VES
* objectInstance - object instance in VE

The VESPA manager receives the application metrics configuration from the
application manager. It subscribes the app notification messages from the 
application manager, and after having received one, requests the latest
application configuration, creates the VES Agent configuration based on it,
and restarts the VES Agent.

The VES Agent does not report any other metrics to VES.

# Prometheus configuration

The VES Agent reads the ricComponentName from Prometheus label
"kubernetes_name".

# VES Collector event format

The VES Agent transmits events to the VES Collector in the 
VES Common Event Format v5.4.1. 
The Common Event Format is expressed in JSON schema v28.4.1.

VES Event Listener 5.4.1:

# Environment variables

The VESPA manager container requires the following environment variables:

* VESMGR_HB_INTERVAL - VES heartbeat interval as a string. For example: 30s.
* VESMGR_MEAS_INTERVAL - Measurement interval as a string. For example: 60s.
* VESMGR_PROMETHEUS_ADDR - Prometheus address. For example: http://127.0.0.1:123


* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_ADDR - Primary collector FQDN as a string. For example: ricaux-entry.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_PORT - Primary collector port id as an integer. Default: 8443.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_SERVERROOT - Path before the /eventListener part of the POST URL as a string.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_TOPIC - Primary collector topic as a string.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_SECURE - Use HTTPS for VES collector. Possible string values: true or false.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_USER - User name as a string.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_PASSWORD - Password as a string.
* VESMGR_PRICOLLECTOR_PASSPHASE - Passphrase as a string.


* VESMGR_APPMGRDOMAIN - Application manager domain. This is for testing purposes, only. Default: service-ricplt-appmgr-http.ricplt.svc.cluster.local.
